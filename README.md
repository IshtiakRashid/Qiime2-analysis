# Qiime2 analysis of 16S gut microbiome from elderly women in Ogimi village, Okinawa, Japan
This repository contains  scripts, metadata, and results for the analysis of 16S rRNA sequencing data of gut microbiome samples using Qiime2. Ogimi is one of Japan's longevity villages and is located in Okinawa prefecture. Samples from elderly women (n=60) were classified into two groups based on whether or not they lived in Ogimi during the first 3 years of their lives, and compared the gut microbiome between these two groups. We collected the data from the published report (Morita, Hiroto, et al. 2021) and performed a re-analysis using qiime2.
